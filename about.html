<p>This project is an attempt to exhaustively quantify the problems of modern technology. The hope is that by thoroughly documenting everything that is wrong, we can start to imagine what a more sustainable future for software, hardware, and society will look like. </p>

<p>The process is as inclusive and transparent as we know how to make it. The Mind Map is written in the open source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_language">DOT language</a> and open to modification by the public via established open source processes. We're convinced that only meaningful way forward is through open dialog. </p>
